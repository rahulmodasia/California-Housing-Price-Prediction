California Housing Price Prediction

California Housing Price Prediction Purpose of The Document 
This document specifies requirements for the project “California Housing Price Prediction”. Apart from the functional and non-functional requirements of the project, it also serves as an input for project scoping.  
Problem Statement 
The purpose of the project is to predict median house values in Californian districts, given many features from these districts.  
We begin by building a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. You are provided with the following resources that can be used as inputs for your model: 
1.	Data with metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. This model should learn from data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics. 2. Districts or block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
